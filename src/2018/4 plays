* Let's write a play

** Let's get started
- Copy paste basic122 into a new file
- Do something

** Here are some play ideas
- The best defense ...
	- No robots on defense. Every robot tries to capture the ball and pivot kick it into the goal.
- Chicken
	- 1 goalie. Every other robot is a submissive defender. 
- Everybody loves Mark
	- Every robot marks an enemy robot
- or come up with your own!

* The best defense ...

** States
- You would have two states
	- Every robot is trying to capture the ball
	- The robot that has captured the ball will try to shoot it into the goal
- What would dictate entering the first state? the second state?
- What would robots need to do upon entering each state, during each state, and upon exiting each state?

* Chicken

** States
- You would have one state where 
	- Every robot that is not a goalie is a submissive defender
- What would dictate entering the first state? 
- What would robots need to do upon entering each state, during each state, and upon exiting each state?

* Everybody loves Mark

** States
- You would have one state
	- Every robot is marking
- What would dictate entering the first state? 
- What would robots need to do upon entering each state, during each state, and upon exiting each state?
